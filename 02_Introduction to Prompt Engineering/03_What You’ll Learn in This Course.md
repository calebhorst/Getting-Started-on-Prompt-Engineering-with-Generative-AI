## What You’ll Learn in This Course
```
This course is fairly short, but if you stick with me, you're going to learn a lot. Here's a breakdown of the course overall. We've got the introduction. This is where we are now, and hopefully, you have a high‑level understanding of what prompts and prompt engineering are. In the next module, we're going to dig into what makes a good prompt, different kinds of prompts and techniques that you can use to get better answers from AI models. Then, we'll move on to evaluating prompt performance. How do you know if a prompt is performing well or not? Then we'll get into some advanced prompt techniques building on the basics. A course about AI and prompt engineering wouldn't be complete without a brief conversation on ethical considerations, so we've got a module about that. And then we'll wrap things up with some best practices and looking ahead to where prompt engineering might go in the future. I'll also point you to some additional resources if you want to continue your learning. So that's a bit about the course, but what about you? Is this the right course for you? As a getting started course, this is appropriate for a large audience, whether you're a data practitioner, a data analyst, machine learning engineer, developer, an engineering manager, really anybody wanting to get more from the generative AI tools that you're using. In terms of prerequisites, you should have a basic understanding of generative AI concepts, what it is, some common ways to use it. If I say things like large language model, you should generally know what that means. And then bonus if you've used tools like ChatGPT and DALL‑E 2 or Midjourney to generate new content, but that's not a requirement. You should be able to follow along with my examples, even if you haven't used these tools before. If you're going to follow along with the demos, and I recommend that you do, you will need an account at platform.openai.com. This account is different from the one that you use for chat.openai.com, which is ChatGPT. This interface in the playground gives us a lot more control over the prompts and parameters and so on. I'll show you some of the features of GPT‑4 in this interface. But for most of the demos, we're going to be using version 3.5. Now, just a quick word about price. If you come out to the pricing page at openai.com and scroll down, it'll give you information about how things are charged, it's basically by tokens, which are pieces of words. 1000 tokens is about 750 words. The pricing is different by model. You'll see the details here. But the good news is if you scroll down a little bit more, if you're just getting started, you're going to get $5 in free credits that you can use during your first three months. In the demos, we're using literally fractions of cents, so $5 should be plenty. And with that, let's get a move on. In the next module, we'll see how to create effective prompts. I'll see you there.
