## Module Summary
```
And with that, lets summarize the important points from the module and then move on to what's next. Depending on the complexity of the task, you may need more advanced prompting techniques to get the desired results. We took a look at zero‑shot and few‑shot, so starting with no examples and then moving on to a few examples. We saw a chain of thought and least to most, breaking complex problems into smaller ones. You can even ask the model to think step by step, which will sometimes let it figure out things on its own. Sometimes it might need a little more help though with you breaking down the questions. And then we also saw generated knowledge, so feeding in additional knowledge like API documentation. So the model can answer more complex problems with newer information. All right, coming up next, let's dive into the ethical considerations around generative AI and prompt engineering. I'll see you there.

## Notes
- **Advanced prompting techniques:** The complexity of tasks often demands employing advanced prompting methods. We explored techniques such as zero-shot (without examples) and few-shot (with a few examples) prompting to train models for specific tasks.

- **Chain of thought and least to most:** These techniques involve breaking down complex problems into smaller, sequential steps. The model follows a logical sequence of questions and answers to reach a final solution. By guiding the model step by step, it can sometimes figure things out independently.

- **Generated knowledge:** Enhancing model performance by providing additional context or information. We saw an example using API documentation, illustrating how feeding in new knowledge allows the model to respond better to complex queries or tasks.

- **Ethical considerations:** Moving forward, the next focus will be on exploring the ethical considerations surrounding generative AI and prompt engineering, highlighting important aspects of responsible and ethical use of these technologies.

Understanding these advanced techniques allows for more nuanced interaction and better outcomes when using generative AI models.
