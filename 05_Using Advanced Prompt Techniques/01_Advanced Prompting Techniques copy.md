## Advanced Prompting Techniques
```
Hi friends and welcome back. We're moving right along . So far in the course, we've covered the basic concepts behind prompt engineering, and we've seen lots of examples that cover the fundamentals. Coming up in this module, we're going to get into more advanced techniques and concepts. Specifically, we'll cover zero‑shot, few‑shot, chain of thought, least to most, and generated knowledge. Now the good news is we've already reviewed examples for some of these previously in the course, so you're already more advanced than you knew. Congratulations. Now let's see why.

## Notes
- Transitioning from basic prompt engineering to more advanced techniques.
- Topics to be covered include zero-shot, few-shot, chain of thought, least to most, and generated knowledge.
- Highlighting familiarity with some of these concepts due to exposure in earlier course examples.
- Aim to delve deeper into these advanced techniques, expanding the understanding of AI model capabilities and prompt engineering strategies.
