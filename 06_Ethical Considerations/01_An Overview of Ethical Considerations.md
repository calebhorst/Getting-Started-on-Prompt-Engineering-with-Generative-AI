## An Overview of Ethical Considerations
```
Hi everyone and welcome back. I'm Amber Israelsen, and thanks for sticking with me on this journey through prompt engineering. I think we can all agree that ChatGPT and GPT and generative AI and everything that goes with it is pretty exciting. Amazing really. But I would be remiss if I didn't spend some time talking about the ethical considerations of all of this. So coming up in this module, I'll overview those considerations, and then we'll talk about some of the strategies to address the concerns, at least from a prompt engineering perspective. So starting with the overview, and this is by no means an exhaustive list. There's probably a dozen more I could add to this. But here are some of the big ones. First is privacy. Generative AI can be used to generate personal and sensitive information and/or could be trained on datasets that include personal details. Think of applications in health care or financial services, for example. This could potentially lead to data and privacy breaches if it falls into the wrong hands. Misinformation and manipulation of data. Generative AI can be used to generate all kinds of things, images, data, deep fake voices, and more that are totally believable, even if they are just straight up false and/or it could have been trained on false data. ChatGPT, for example, scrapes the internet for information, and we all know that the internet is full of things that are not totally correct. Bias and fairness. Once again, LLMs like ChatGPT are trained on massive amounts of data from the internet. And no surprise, there's biased data on the internet. This could be around things like race, gender, age, and a lot more. And if people or machines are using that output to make decisions, that could lead to potential discrimination or unfair outcomes. Ownership and copyright. Who owns the output of generative AI? Is it the developer, the operator, the AI itself, or the people who created the data that the AI was trained on? And what about the ownership or copyright of the data that it was trained on? How does all of that work? Next is the lack of transparency and explainability. Generative AI models are often referred to as black boxes because it's really hard to know how they generate their outputs. This lack of transparency can lead to ethical concerns because we just don't fully understand the implications of the technology or what it can do or is doing. And then finally, job displacement. This is top of mind for a lot of people. Will AI take my job? It's a valid concern and one that pops up every time there's a big technological shift. These are all really big concerns, and the solutions are going to require all of us, meaning society in general, you and me, governments, and institutions. So I won't even pretend to have all the answers here. But from a prompt engineering perspective, we can play a small part. So let's talk about some strategies around that next.

## Notes
- **Privacy:** Generative AI can produce sensitive information, raising concerns about data privacy and potential breaches, particularly in domains like healthcare or financial services.

- **Misinformation and manipulation:** The technology can create convincing content, including deep fakes and false data, posing risks of spreading misinformation.

- **Bias and fairness:** Models trained on biased datasets may perpetuate biases, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes, especially in decision-making processes.

- **Ownership and copyright:** Determining ownership of the AI-generated content, the AI itself, or the data used for training raises complex legal and ethical questions.

- **Lack of transparency and explainability:** Generative AI models often lack transparency, making it challenging to understand their decision-making process and implications.

- **Job displacement:** Concerns about AI's impact on employment and job displacement due to technological advancements.

While addressing these concerns requires collective efforts from society, governments, institutions, and individuals, prompt engineering can contribute to mitigating some of these challenges by adopting specific strategies. Amber is likely to delve into these strategies to navigate the ethical landscape of AI technology in the upcoming discussions.
