## Module Summary
```
This was a fairly short module. But hopefully, it got you thinking about some of the bigger implications of this generative AI world that we find ourselves in. I think it's safe to say there's lots of concerns out there around generative AI and prompt engineering. This is a relatively new space with lots of unknowns, and it's growing rapidly. A lot of these concerns will have to be addressed at the highest levels, societies, governments, institutions. But as prompt engineers, you can play a small part by using some of the techniques we talked about to reduce bias, misinformation, copyright infringement, and to help maintain privacy and transparency. And with that, let's move on to our final module. We'll summarize a lot of what we've talked about by putting it into best practices. And then we'll also take a look at current trends and future directions in this space. I'll see you there.

## Notes
- Reflected on the broader implications of generative AI and prompt engineering. While many concerns exist in this evolving field, addressing them will require action at societal, governmental, and institutional levels. 
- As prompt engineers, there's a role in leveraging techniques discussed to mitigate bias, misinformation, copyright issues, and to prioritize privacy and transparency.
