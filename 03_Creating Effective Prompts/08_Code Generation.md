## Code Generation
```
The next type of prompt is for code generation or writing code, whether it's JavaScript, T‑SQL, Python, C++, CSS. Whatever your favorite language is, we've got you covered here. To let the model know that you want to write code, you can use code comments like here, the hashtags, and we're asking it to write some Python 3 code. So we want to calculate the mean distance between an array of points. Over on the right, you'll see that I've dialed my Temperature back to 0 because I really don't want a lot of variety here. I just want actual working code. So let's submit this and get it started on the Python code for us. And you'll see that its stopped here kind of in the middle of our code. So if you ever have that happen where you're getting incomplete answers, its probably because of the Maximum length over here. So if you hover over this, this controls the number of tokens that are being generated. And you'll see that one token is roughly four characters in English text. So I've got mine set to just 100, which is obviously not enough for this code. So I would need to bump that up to something higher. It's also important to note that this is how you're charged. So going out to the Pricing page and scrolling down, pricing is different for each model. We're currently using ChatGPT‑3.5 Turbo, so it won't cost you a fortune, but just know that as you're dialing up the maximum number there, that will incur additional charges. But back to our example, I could increase the length here to 500, start this prompt again, and then I should get the completed code. Another thing you can do with code is get the model started by using an open curly brace. So here we're starting the function, giving it a descriptive name so it would know the functionality that we're trying to get here, and then saying okay, GPT, you take it from here after this open curly brace. So let's see this one in the playground. I'll hit Submit, and here we go. It's writing us some code to validate a web address. We've got our regex and so on. Another way you can use comments is with the triple quotes like this. Here we're saying, I want you to generate some code from the instructions in the quotes. And then here I'm going to get you started with query =, so an example of writing SQL code. We've got the query = here, let's submit, and there's our SELECT statement. Here's another example, this time for data generation. Here we've got this in the triple quotes, and out in the playground, let's see what we get here. So here it's writing code for us. Now we didn't specifically tell it that we wanted code, right? We just said here's three things I want you to do. But because we have this in triple quotes, it knows to write the code. If we were to get rid of these and I'll just give it a list of things to do here and submit, here it's just giving us text names and no code. And I'll cancel that. So it's the triple quotes set of the magic for the code. Just a couple more examples around code. You can use this to convert or translate code between two languages like here from JavaScript to Python, and then we're getting it started at the end with Python:. Let's see what we get here, and it's giving us the Python code. We saw earlier that you can use a model to explain things, and code is no exception. Here we're using comments again saying this is MyFunction and then comments at the end asking What does this function do? This can be super helpful if you're taking over somebody else's code base or you found some code on Stack Overflow or something and you need an explanation. And finally, a favorite of mine, you can use it to fix bugs in your code. So let's say that you know there's some bugs in your code, you get an error when you ran it or something like that. You can just ask the model to fix your code. So here we're using delimiters to mark the major sections of this ask, the hashtags, so Fix bugs in the below function. Then I've got three hashtags for the Buggy Python code and then the Fixed Python code, basically getting it started. So let's see how this does, and it's giving us updated code. You can also paste in errors that you get when you run your code and just say, Why is this error happening? Can you fix it? And it'll fix your code for you, which is pretty amazing.

## Notes
In the context of code generation prompts:

- **Instruction Clarity**:
  - The instructions guide the model to write specific code snippets. Using comments such as hashtags or triple quotes helps delineate instructions from the code, signaling the model about the type of code to generate.

- **Temperature Control and Length Constraints**:
  - Adjusting the Temperature parameter influences the code's variability and creativity. A lower value ensures more precise, factual code, while a higher value adds creativity, possibly generating different code variations.
  - Managing the Maximum Length parameter is crucial to ensure complete responses. Incomplete code snippets may occur due to restricted token counts. Increasing this limit allows the model to produce entire code snippets.

- **Code Generation Techniques**:
  - Providing cues like open curly braces or using specific language syntax cues the model to write code, allowing it to generate functional snippets based on the given context.
  - Employing triple quotes or hashtags within comments is a powerful technique to instruct the model to generate code, allowing for tasks like validating web addresses, writing SQL queries, generating data, translating code between languages, explaining code functionality, or fixing bugs.

- **Error Handling and Debugging**:
  - The model can be directed to fix bugs within code by highlighting sections of the code that require modification or by pasting error messages and requesting code fixing or error explanations.
  
These strategies allow for the generation of functional code across various programming languages, enabling tasks ranging from code explanation and bug fixing to translation and code generation based on specific instructions.
