## The Anatomy of a Prompt
```
Hi, friends, and welcome back. We've made it to the next module in this course about prompt engineering with generative AI, I'm still Amber Israelsen. Before we dive into how to create effective prompts, let's go over the basic anatomy or components of a prompt, starting with the persona. If your model is supposed to take on a certain role or perspective, then the prompt should indicate that. For example, we could say respond like a software developer or a scientist or a novelist. Then we have the instructions. This is the heart of the prompt, the thing that you're asking the model to do. These should be clear and concise, reducing as much ambiguity as possible. Then we have input content. Depending on the task, this could be a piece of text that you want the model to summarize or a question to answer. If you have any requirements around the format of the output, you can specify those here. For example, maybe you want a bullet point list or commaâ€‘separated values or something in the format of a Tweet or a formal report. And then any additional information that would help the model generate a better response, this could be context about the task, any background knowledge, or constraints that the model should adhere to. Now, not all prompts will have all of these components, but obviously, you'll need to have at least one, which is going to be the instructions. Now, let's look at an example. Using all of our components, a prompt might look something like this, as a professional movie critic, please write a review of the movie, John Wick: Chapter 4, in a concise, compelling manner, focusing on plot, performances, and visual effects and then avoid revealing any major spoilers. So with that short intro to what a prompt is, the components that it might have, let's dig into this module about how to create effective prompts. We'll start by looking at the interfaces available for prompting like ChatGPT or Bard and then some of the advantages that you'll get by using OpenAI's Playground. And then the rest of the module will focus on lots of different use cases and examples for prompts, depending on what you're trying to accomplish. These examples should help you pick the right one for the job. We'll take a look at factual responses, text summarization, text extraction, text classification, conversation, code generation, and reasoning and math. So let's get started.

## Notes
Absolutely! Here's a summary:

- **Components of a Prompt**:
  - **Persona**: Defines the role or perspective the model should adopt (e.g., software developer, scientist, etc.).
  - **Instructions**: The core of the prompt, clear and concise, specifying the model's task.
  - **Input Content**: Text or question guiding the model, sometimes including output format requirements.
  - **Additional Information**: Context, background, or constraints enhancing the model's response.

- **Prompt Example**:
  - Example Prompt: "As a professional movie critic, please write a review of the movie, John Wick: Chapter 4, in a concise, compelling manner. Focus on plot, performances, and visual effects. Avoid revealing major spoilers."

- **Module Overview**:
