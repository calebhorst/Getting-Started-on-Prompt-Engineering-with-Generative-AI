## Interfaces for Prompting
```
At the beginning of the course, I mentioned that I'm going to be using the OpenAI Playground for my demos, but that's not the only place you can do prompting. There are several other large language models that you can use. Some of the big players are shown here on the slide. Taking a brief look at these, let's head out to Bing. Using the Chat functionality of Bing, you can enter your prompt down here, and you get some basic options around the conversation style. So we could say, let's be a little bit more creative and we will ask to explain large language models for my grandma. And here's our response, along with some footnotes or links where we can learn more. So Bing is definitely an option. You can also use the ChatGPT app or Chat interface. A lot of you are probably familiar with this. We could ask the same question here. We don't really get a lot of options around the style or amount of creativity or anything like that, but we'll get a nice response here in a human‑friendly tone. And then taking a quick look at Google Bard, we've got a similar experience here, and we should get a response that would be appropriate for my grandma. And there we go. So if you're using one of these other interfaces, you can absolutely do prompt engineering using a lot of the techniques that we'll be learning together in this course. Prompt engineering is not specific to just one tool. But if you use OpenAI's playground, which I'll be doing, you do get some nice additional features and parameters that will make it easier to get to the output you're looking for, and that's why I've chosen this for the rest of the course. We'll be in here a lot in the upcoming modules. But just to give you a quick overview of this interface starting with Modes over here, the modes will control which models you have access to. So in Chat mode, for example, we get access to the newer models including gpt‑4, 3.5‑turbo, and there's other models here as well. All of these are optimized for slightly different use cases. If you look at the Legacy Complete mode, this will give you access to some of the older models. And if you hover over these, it will tell you exactly what the model is capable of, its strengths and so on, and then there's additional models as well. So you'll just get more control over what's happening behind the scenes. If you go with the Chat mode here, you'll see that you get this SYSTEM window over here. This is basically the persona that we talked about before, so any kind of background or perspective or role that you want to give the model to get to a better output. Going back to the example we were using earlier, this is where we would say you are a professional movie critic, and then over here is where you add the instructions. And once again, just using that same text from our example, and then we'll say Submit. And here's where the assistant or the model basically gives you the output. If you're not working in this mode, it's still possible to use that persona or the background context just by entering it at the top of the prompt. And we'll see a lot more of that as we go along. One other nice feature that you get here with the Playground is the ability to look at some presets. So if we browse examples here, we'll get some nice starter prompts in a variety of categories. So maybe you want to explain code. This will give you an example prompt of how you could ask for that or a lot of other things here as well. Going back to the Playground. As you switch between Mode and Model here, you'll see that you get parameters that you can modify down here to help you get to the output that you want. Taking you back to the slides for a second, let's walk through a few of these. So the Model, we've already seen that. That will determine which parameters are available to you, so make sure you select that first. And then looking at some of the more common ones that you want to adjust, we have Temperature. This will determine how variable or creative the responses are. The higher the number, the more creativity is used. Maximum length, this controls the length of the response and, hence, also how much you pay. This is basically the tokens that will come back in the response. Top P will control the diversity of your responses, and the Frequency and Presence penalties, these control the likelihood of repeating the same line and likelihood of talking about new topics. So again, we'll touch on these a lot more as we go through different demos, but just know that creating effective prompts might involve tweaking some of these knobs to get things dialed in just right. Now, let's move on to talking about the different types of prompts.
