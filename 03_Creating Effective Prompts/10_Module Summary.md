## Module Summary
```
Okay, we've covered a ton of content in this module. Let's do a quick recap and then move on to what's next. We saw that there's no one‑size‑fits‑all approach when it comes to prompt engineering. If you're trying to generate code, you're going to use different instructions than if you're trying to summarize a text for fifth graders. So use the right prompt for the task at hand and then adjust parameters as necessary. We saw some things like temperature and max length of tokens. And then we saw some ways that you can help the model by separating your instructions using delimiters, such as hashtags or triple quotes. Being specific and descriptive, the more specific the better. And then providing examples, examples in the input and also examples for how you want the output formatted. So we know the basics of putting together prompts for different use cases or tasks. Coming up in the next module, we'll talk about how to evaluate those prompts and how to improve upon them. I'll see you there.

## Notes
- The importance of tailoring prompts to specific tasks, understanding

their differences based on the task at hand, and adjusting parameters like temperature and token length.
- Techniques for aiding models, such as using delimiters and being specific and descriptive in instructions.
- The significance of providing examples for both input and desired output formats.
- Preparing for the next module, which focuses on evaluating and enhancing prompts for better performance.

Ready to dive into evaluation and refinement!
